      <p>Purpose: The portfolio project indicates that the student has mastered certain skills in chemistry 111. It is indicated by using various artifacts. This project helps us realize that we are prepared for the next section of chemistry and we understood this class. It is very important to me to make this portfolio because it showcases all of the hard work I have done this semester.</p>
      <p>Introduction: My name is Joel Miller, and my major is Computer Science. I am taking chemistry only because I have to. I need 4 semesters of a natural science, and chemistry appealed to me the most. The purpose relates to my career choice by making sure I understand what I am studying and always prepared for the next chapter of my life. Computer Science applies a lot of chemistry procedures and uses a lot of applications from this class. Chemistry has a lot of math and problem-solving skills which directly relate to Computer Science. The six learning objectives are effectively communicating the goals of experiments in writing, accurately record experimental procedures, accurately record data, observations, and results, effectively communicate reasonable conclusions about experiments, effectively defend conclusions in writing through the use of data and/or results, and effectively present and analyze graphical information when appropriate. All these objectives ensure that the student has mastered chemistry 111.</p>
    
      <h3>Objective 1: Effectively Communicating Goals of an Experiment in Writing</h3>
      <p>Effectively communicating goals of an experiment in writing is very important in my major because if you do not communicate, errors and mistakes could be made. Also, communicating is very important in life because without it, things cannot be accomplished. In the chemistry lab, communicating goals can be seen through the purpose of the lab. The purpose explains what the objectives/goals will be of that lab. Lab 2 (Chromatography) is a perfect example of this objective. Effectively communicating the goals of the experiment through writing can be shown through problems and questions in this experiment. I chose this because it demonstrates communication through writing and also effectively describes the goals that will be completed.</p>
      <p>Purpose: Artifact 1:</p>
      <p>In today’s lab, we will mainly focus on chromatography. We will be using chromatography to separate and identify chemical substances. A thing to realize is that polarity plays a big role in chromatography. Polar solute molecules attract polar solvent molecules, in like ways nonpolar solute does not attract polar solvent. Today’s lab will contain experiments used to investigate the dyes used in felt-tip pens compounds producing colors in leaves and identification of inorganic ions in solution.</p>
